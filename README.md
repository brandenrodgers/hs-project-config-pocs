# HubSpot Project Configuration POC's
A repository used to track new ideas for project configuration. This is purely for the sake of idea generation. It will not replace research or any sort of formal proposal. Ideally this repo and the POC PR's will help us to identify some patterns and use cases that we like and also ones that we don't like.

View the [Home Base doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1R1Ypkwtk74kk2BieVUgu4JDoXt_ZjXvOZHd2IgincRs/edit) for more information about the Project configuration effort.

Keep in mind our criteria and constraints while analyzing these solutions. It's unlikely that we'll find a solution that perfectly solves for every feature and use case that we can think of. We'll have to be opinionated about which critera are more important than others.
